# Configuration

`guillotina` and its addons define a global configuration that is used.
All of these settings are configurable by providing a
JSON configuration file or yaml to the start script.

By default, the startup script looks for a `config.yaml` file. You can use a different
file by using the `-c` option for the script like this: `./bin/guillotina -c myconfig.yaml`.

## Applications

To load guillotina applications into your application, use the `applications` setting:

```yaml
applications:
  - guillotina_elasticsearch
```

## Databases

Guillotina can use PostgreSQL out-of-the-box.

To configure available databases, use the `databases` option. Configuration options
map 1-to-1 to database setup:

```yaml
---
databases:
  db:
    storage: postgresql
    dsn: postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/guillotina
    read_only: false
    pool_size: 40
    read_only: false
    statement_cache_size: 100
    max_cached_statement_lifetime: 300
```

In this configuration, the `db` key referenced in configuration here will be mapped
to the url `http://localhost:8080/db`.

Currently supported database drivers are:

- `postgresql`
- `cockroach`
- `DUMMY`: in-memory database, useful in testing
- `DUMMY_FILE`: simple file storage, useful in testing

### Database configuration options

- `pool_size`: Size of connection pool. (defaults to `13`)
- `transaction_strategy`: Connection strategy to use. See `Transaction strategy`\_ for details. (defaults to `resolve_readcommitted`)
- `conn_acquire_timeout`: How long to wait for connection to be freed up from pool. (defaults to `20`)
- `objects_table_name`: Table name to store object data. (defaults to `objects`)
- `blobs_table_name`: Table name to store blob data. (defaults to `blobs`)
- `autovacuum`: Default vacuum relies on pg referential integrity to delete all objects. If you have extremely large databases,
  this can be very heavy on pg. Set this to `false` and run the `dbvacuum` command in a cronjob. (defaults to `true`)

### Storages

Guillotina also provides the ability to dynamically create databases with the `@storages` endpoint.
But in order to utilize this feature, you need to configure the databases connection settings.

These are configured in much of the same way as databases.

```yaml
storages:
  bucket:
    storage: postgresql
    dsn: postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432
```

Notice how it's missing the database part of the dsn.

## Static files

```yaml
static:
  favicon.ico: static/favicon.ico
  static_files: module_name:static
```

These files will then be available on urls `/favicon.ico` and `/static_files`.

## JavaScript Applications

We can also serve JS apps from guillotina. These will allow routing on your
JS application without any extra configuration by returning the base directory
`index.html` for every sub directory in the url.

Once there is SSR support in Python, guillotina will integrate with it through
this as well.

```yaml
jsapps:
  app: path/to/app
```

## Root user password

```yaml
root_user:
  password: root
```

## CORS

```yaml
cors:
  allow_origin:
    - '*'
  allow_methods:
    - GET
    - POST
    - DELETE
    - HEAD
    - PATCH
    - PUT
  allow_headers:
    - '*'
  expose_headers:
    - '*'
  allow_credentials: true
  max_age: 3660
```


## Applications

To extend/override Guillotina, the `applications` configuration allows you to
specify which to enable.

```yaml
applications:
  - guillotina_elasticsearch
```

## Async utilities

Guillotina has support for injecting dependencies from configuration with
asynchronous utility.

An async utility is a class that implements `initialize` and `finalize` method.
The `initialize` method is run at application start as a task. This gives
you the power to hook async tasks into guillotina.

```yaml
load_utilities:
  catalog:
    provides: guillotina.interfaces.ICatalogUtility
    factory: guillotina_elasticsearch.utility.ElasticSearchUtility
    settings: {}
```

## Middleware

Guillotina has support for ASGI middlewares.

You can provide an array of dotted names to use for your application.

```yaml
middlewares:
  - sentry_sdk.integrations.asgi.SentryAsgiMiddleware
  - guillotina_myaddon.Middleware
```


## Server settings

You can pass `server_settings` to configure the ASGI server.

```yaml
server_settings:
  client_max_size: 20971520
```

## JWT Settings

If you want to enable JWT authentication, you'll need to configure the JWT
secret in Guillotina.

```yaml
jwt:
  secret: foobar
  algorithm: HS256
```

Additionally, to work with websockets, you'll need to configure the `jwk` setting:

```yaml
jwk:
  k: QqzzWH1tYqQO48IDvW7VH7gvJz89Ita7G6APhV-uLMo
  kty: oct
```

## Miscellaneous settings

- `port` (number): Port to bind to. _defaults to `8080`_
- `store_json` (boolean): Serialize object into json field in database. _defaults to `true`_
- `host` (string): Where to host the server. _defaults to `"127.0.0.1"`_
- `port` (number): Port to bind to. _defaults to `8080`_
- `conflict_retry_attempts` (number): Number of times to retry database conflict errors. _defaults to `3`_
- `cloud_storage` (string): Dotted path to cloud storage field type. _defaults to `"guillotina.interfaces.IDBFileField"`_
- `loop_policy`: (string): Be able to customize the event loop policy used. For example, to use
  uvloop, set this value to `uvloop.EventLoopPolicy`.
- `router`: be able to customize the main Router class
- `uid_generator`: be able to customize the function used to generate uids on the system.
  defaults to `guillotina.db.uid.generate_uid`
- `cors_renderer`: customize the cors renderer, defaults to `guillotina.cors.DefaultCorsRenderer`
- `indexer`: customize the class used to index content, defaults to
  `guillotina.catalog.index.Indexer`

## Transaction strategy

Guillotina provides a few different modes to operate in to customize the level
of performance versus consistency. The setting used for this is `transaction_strategy`
which defaults to `resolve`.

Even though we have different transaction strategies that provide different voting
algorithms to decide if it's a safe write, all write operations STILL make sure that the
object committed matches the transaction it was retrieved with. If not,
a conflict error is detected and the request is retried. So even if you choose
the transaction strategy with no database transactions, there is still a level
of consistency so that you know you will only modify an object that is consistent
with the one retrieved from the database.

Example configuration:

```yaml
databases:
  - db:
      storage: postgresql
      transaction_strategy: resolve
      dsn: postgresql://postgres@localhost:5432/guillotina
```

Available options:

- `none`:
  No db transaction, no conflict resolution. Fastest but most dangerous mode.
  Use for importing data or if you need high performance and do not have multiple writers.
- `tidonly`:
  The same as `none` with no database transaction; however, we still use the database
  to issue us transaction ids for the data committed. Since no transaction is used,
  this is potentially just as safe as any of the other strategies just as long
  as you are not writing to multiple objects at the same time â€” in those cases,
  you might be in an inconsistent state on `tid` conflicts.
- `dbresolve`:
  Use db transaction but do not perform any voting when writing(no conflict resolution).
- `dbresolve_readcommitted`:
  Same as no vote; however, db transaction only started at commit phase. This
  should provide better performance; however, you'll need to consider the side
  affects of this for reading data.
- `simple`:
  Detect concurrent transactions and error if another transaction id is committed
  to the db ahead of the current transaction id. This is the safest mode to operate
  in but you might see conflict errors.
- `resolve`:
  Same as simple; however, it allows commits when conflicting transactions
  are writing to different objects.
- `resolve_readcommitted`:
  Same as resolve however, db transaction only started at commit phase. This
  should provide better performance; however, you'll need to consider the side
  affects of this for reading data.

Warning: not all storages are compatible with all transaction strategies.

## Connection class

The default asyncpg connection class has some overhead. Guillotina provides
a way to override it with a custom class or a provided lighter one:

```yaml
pg_connection_class: guillotina.db.storages.pg.LightweightConnection
```

## Authentication and Authorization

### Extractors

`auth_extractors` are what you can configure to decide how we extract potential
credential information from a request.

The default value is:

```yaml
auth_extractors
- guillotina.auth.extractors.BearerAuthPolicy
- guillotina.auth.extractors.BasicAuthPolicy
- guillotina.auth.extractors.WSTokenAuthPolicy
```

However, there is also a `guillotina.auth.extractors.CookiePolicy` available if you
want to extract a credential from an `auth_token` cookie as well.

Available:

- guillotina.auth.extractors.BearerAuthPolicy: Looks for `Bearer` Authorization header
- guillotina.auth.extractors.BasicAuthPolicy: Looks for `Basic` Authorization header
- guillotina.auth.extractors.WSTokenAuthPolicy: Looks for `ws_token` query param

### Identifiers

`auth_user_identifiers` is a mechanism to customize how we lookup and validate
users against an extracted credential.

For example, this is the main part of what
[guillotina_dbusers](https://github.com/guillotinaweb/guillotina_dbusers) does
and the only configuration setting it needs/provides.

By default, guillotina does not provide a user identifier plugin and only authenticates
the root user/password.

### Validators

`auth_token_validators` allows you to customize what kind of values we'll authorize extracted
credentials and identified users against.

- guillotina.auth.validators.JWTValidator: Validate extract jwt token
- guillotina.auth.validators.SaltedHashPasswordValidator: Validate extracted password against
  stored salted and hashed password

## Configuration life cycle

Guillotina and `applications` you define might provide their own configuration that you can override
but they might also override the default configuration of guillotina as well.

Guillotina configuration is not considered fully loaded until the entire application has started up
and finished loading all it's dependencies.

Because of this, you can not reference global `app_settings` at module scope or in any application
startup code.

The order of application configuration and override loading in order of more precedence to lower is:

- startup yaml/json file
- applications defined in the `applications` configuration, in order
- guillotina base configuration
